## 🚀 News
Our paper: "Repo2Run: Automated Building Executable Environment for Code Repository at Scale" has been accepted by **NeurIPS 2025** main track as a **spotlight**!

An LLM-based build agent system that helps manage and automate build processes in containerized environments. This project provides tools for handling dependencies, resolving conflicts, and managing build configurations.

## 😊 Features

- Docker-based sandbox environment for isolated builds
- Automated dependency management and conflict resolution
- Support for Python version management
- Waiting list and conflict list management for package dependencies
- Error format handling and output collection

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Docker
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/repo2run.git
cd repo2run
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Usage

The main entry point is through the build agent's main script. You can run it with the following arguments:

```bash
python build_agent/main.py --full_name <repository_full_name> --sha <sha> --root_path <root_path> --llm <llm_name>
```

Where:
- `repository_full_name`: The full name of the repository (e.g., user/repo)
- `sha`: The commit SHA
- `root_path`: The root path for the build process
- `llm_name`: The name of the LLM model to use for configuration (default: gpt-4o-2024-05-13)

## 🔍 Note
💡 For example, you can use the following repository—which is relatively easy to set up—to verify whether there are any issues with running it. I have already confirmed that it can be successfully configured on several mainstream models, including GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

```
python build_agent/main.py --full_name "Benexl/FastAnime" --sha "677f4690fab4651163d0330786672cf1ba1351bf" --root_path . --llm "gpt-4o-2024-05-13"
```

You can use this relatively easy-to-configure repository as a baseline to evaluate whether your chosen model can effectively handle this type of task. If the entire program starts successfully, the corresponding repository contents will be saved under `utils/repo`, and an `output` folder will be created with a structure like the following:
- `inner_commands.json`
- `output_commands.json`
- `pip_list.json`
- `pipdeptree.json`
- `pipdeptree.txt`
- `sha.txt`
- `track.json`
- `track.txt`

If you successfully configure the repository, there will be the following files:
- `Dockerfile`
- `code_edit.py`
- `test.txt`

Please note: if the `output` folder does not contain trajectory files such as `track.json`, it indicates that there was an issue during execution. You can first check it yourself; if other problems arise, feel free to open a GitHub Issue.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- `build_agent/` - Main package directory
  - `agents/` - Agent implementations for build configuration
  - `utils/` - Utility functions and helper classes
  - `docker/` - Docker-related configurations
  - `main.py` - Main entry point
  - `multi_main.py` - Multi-process support

## 🔍 Features in Detail

### 1. Docker-based Sandbox Environment
The project uses Docker containers to create isolated build environments, ensuring clean and reproducible builds.

### 2. Automated Dependency Management
- **Waiting List**: Manages package installation queue
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles version conflicts between packages
- **Error Handling**: Formats and processes build errors

### 3. Python Version Management
Supports multiple Python versions for build environments.

### 4. Configuration Agent
Utilizes GPT models to assist in build configuration and problem resolution.

## 🔧 Contributing
If you’d like to modify Repo2Run to better suit your needs, we’ve outlined some potential improvement plans. Due to time constraints, we may not be able to complete these changes immediately. However, if you implement any of them, we warmly welcome you to submit a PR and contribute to the project!
1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## 🙋 Q&A
We’ve collected some common issues for your reference. If you encounter something that isn’t covered or resolved, feel free to open an Issue.

### 1. The program won’t start, or you can’t proceed to the next step after downloading the repository
A: I recommend first running our suggested example to verify that your workflow can run end to end. If files like `track.json` are not generated in your `output` folder, it’s usually an environment configuration issue. Check whether Docker has started correctly.
### 2. The program runs, but the model keeps throwing errors like: “ERROR! Your reply does not contain valid block or final answer”
A: This error originates from `agents/configuration.py`, which checks whether the LLM’s reply contains a command structure wrapped in triple backticks ```. In practice, we’ve clearly specified the required output format in the prompt; at least in our tests, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet did not exhibit this issue. If you encounter it, we suggest first inspecting the LLM’s raw output (e.g., `track.json` or `track.txt`).
### 3. Docker download speed inside the container is too slow, and how to set a proxy
A: You can modify the `generate_dockerfile` function in the `Sandbox` class located at `utils/sandox.py`. It manages the generation of the initial Dockerfile. You can add statements like `ENV http_proxy=XXX` to configure the network proxy.

## 🔧 Proposed future improvements
(we’ll work on these when time permits; PRs are very welcome)
### 1. System Prompt adaptability
  - You can modify the System Prompt in the `Configuration` class within `configuration.py`. The current prompt is tailored to GPT-4o and may not be suitable for other models (e.g., smaller models may exceed context limits).
### 2. Multi-language support (beyond Python)
  - The current version supports Python. To add other languages, the main steps are:
    - a. Modify the prompt
    - b. Add the corresponding package management tool in `tools` (see `apt_download.py` and `pip_download.py` for reference)
    - c. Change the base image
#### Reference table:
| Language | Docker base image | Installation tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | python:[version] | pip |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | node:[version] | npm |
| Java | openjdk:[version] | maven |
| Rust | rust:[version] | cargo |
| Ruby | ruby:[version] | bundler |
| R | r-base:[version] | install.packages |
| Go | golang:[version] | go get |
| PHP | php:[version] | composer |
### 3. Rethinking “successful configuration” signals
  - Currently, success is defined narrowly: all tests must be runnable (i.e., `pytest --collect-only` does not error). In practice, many repositories contain inherently failing or non-runnable tests, which blocks configuration success.
  - We think this can be improved. If you want to tailor the criteria, modify `tools/runtest.py` and `tools/poetryruntest.py`.
  - This part can be flexible, for example:
    - Stricter: require tests to pass
    - Looser: only require 80% of tests to run, or passing a specific test, etc.
